# Analysis of Pokemon games across Generations
## Data sources
1. Strength and population statistics about Pokemon from generations 1-8: [Complete Pokemon Dataset from Kaggle][https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420]
2. Pokemon type advatange statistics: [Pokemon Type Chart][https://www.theloadout.com/pokemon-type-chart]


## Analysis
The questions we answered about our database are:
1. Is there a pattern of difference between Legendary, SubLegendary Pokemon i.e. population indicators,
types, weakest and strongest against?

2. What are the differences between Mythical and non-Mythical pokemon, in terms of HP, Attack and
Defence, SpecialAttack and SpecialDefence, Speed, and CatchRate? What was the first generation
a mythical pokemon appeared in, and how many abilities do mythical pokemon have, compared to
non-mythical pokemon?

3. What is the distribution of Pokemon over generations? Is there a pattern of future generations being
more diverse (i.e. more types) or overpowering the previous generations?
